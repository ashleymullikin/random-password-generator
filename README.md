Password Generator

This tool is used to show my current skill set and abilities in Java script in conjunction with html and css. I has the user input how many characters they want their password to be, if they want to include upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers 0-9, and special characters. Which can be used or not depending on the user input, but if they user chooses none of the options they will get an error/alert that they need to choose at least one. Similarly if they pick less than a certain number of characters they will be told to try again and that a strong password has at least 12 characters.

Prerequisites
    -Have internet access
    -Have base knowledge of html, java, and css
    -be able to run visual sutdio code or pull up the active link via a web browser

How to use the thing:
1. opne the link in a web browser
2. click generate password and then input how many characters in the dialogue box that you would like, shown in image below

3. Then multiple boxes will show up asking if you want the upper, lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. You say okay if you do and cancel if you will not. 
4. Then your password will show up in the box on the screen as shown in the screenshot below.
