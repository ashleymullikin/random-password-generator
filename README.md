Password Generator

This tool is used to show my current skill set and abilities in Java script in conjunction with html and css. I has the user input how many characters they want their password to be, if they want to include upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers 0-9, and special characters. Which can be used or not depending on the user input, but if they user chooses none of the options they will get an error/alert that they need to choose at least one. Similarly if they pick less than a certain number of characters they will be told to try again and that a strong password has at least 12 characters.

Prerequisites
    -Have internet access
    -Have base knowledge of html, java, and css
    -be able to run visual sutdio code or pull up the active link via a web browser
